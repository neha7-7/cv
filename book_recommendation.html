    <p>
      I Am Watching You by Teresa Driscoll is an intriguing thriller. Though the premise is simple, <br />
      the way it's told is interesting.This is a debut novel by the writer and it's quite a sparkling start.<br />
       The book does well to maintain an even pace - though it's not exactly a fast paced crime thriller. <br />
       The element of suspense - that is what defines a good mystery book - has been well created and it hangs<br />
        in throughout the novel till its end.
